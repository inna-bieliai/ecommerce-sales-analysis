## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Technology leads in profitability** — 17.4% profit margin vs 2.5% for Furniture
2. **Business is growing** — Sales grew +29% in 2016 and +20% in 2017 after a slight dip in 2015
3. **Q4 is peak season** — November and December consistently drive the highest revenue every year
4. **Tables and Bookcases are loss-making** — Despite $206K in sales, Tables generate -$17,725 in losses
5. **Discounts above 20% are unprofitable** — Clear breaking point between 20% and 30% discount
6. **Texas is a major problem** — $170K in sales but -$25,729 in losses (-15% margin)

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- **Stop discounting above 20%** — every discount tier above 20% results in losses
- **Review Furniture pricing strategy** — Tables and Bookcases need price adjustment or discontinuation
- **Focus on Technology** — highest margin category with strong growth potential
- **Invest in West region** — highest profit margin (14.9%) and sales volume
- **Investigate Central region** — lowest margin (7.9%) despite decent sales volume

- `HAVING` for post-aggregation filtering
- Common Table Expressions (`WITH ... AS`)
- Window Functions: `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`, `LAG()` for YoY growth
- `EXTRACT()` for date parts
- `UNION ALL` for combining result sets
